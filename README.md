Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

In this application, I needed to create a database that had at least three tables. One to store the daily weight, one to store user logins and passwords, and one to store the goal weight. I also had to have a login screen that lets users create a login if they havent created one before, a screen with a grid to display the daily weights, a way to add the daily weight, a way to add the daily goal, and a way for the app to notify the user when they reached their goal weight. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

For this app, I had to make sure I had a minimum of four screens. The first was the login screen, the second was the create user screen, the third was the screen to add, delete, edit, and view the daily weights/dates/goal weight, and the last was the screen that actually let you view everything you have entered. I think it was very user friendly as it was easy on the eyes, the fonts were big and clear, as well as the buttons making them easy to click when necessary. I think my designs were sucessful because I kept the user in mind the entire time I was creating the application. This led to a smooth user experience.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I had to watch a lot of youtube videos, as well as refer back to the zybooks information a lot. I had never created an app before, and I don't usually use an android (I have an iPhone), so there was a bit of a learning curve for me. It also helped using stack overflow. When I found myself too confused, I would ask one of my friends for guidance, and they would teach me what certain things meant. I think these are good strategies for the future, because these resources will almost always be available to me. I know most coders find theirselves on stack overflow during their work day, so I don't think it was any different.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I used the android emulator that is built into android studio in order to test my code. The first thing I had to do was test that I could actually create a user. Then I had to test that those user logins and passwords would actually log me in afterwards. Then I had to test that the informaitno put in by one user would only be viewable on their personal account. Then it was more so a game of checking all the buttons worked and that the functionality made sense from a user standpoint. I had seen a few problems, like the logo for my app disappearing for no reason, or user information from another user being viewable by someone else. These were all fixed before turnin.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The most difficult part was the coding itself. I really enjoy UI design, I feel like it is something that I am good at, but the coding aspect is where it tends to get a bit more difficult. I had to teach myself how to code for android studio, and what a lot of the information meant. It was very confusing, and overwhelming to only have a limited amount of time to learn it before actually applying it. I think desipte the difficulties coding, I still shined in my UI area and demonstrated that I have a good understanding of user needs.
